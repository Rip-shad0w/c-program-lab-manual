# c-program-lab-manual
This repository contains a structured collection of programs and solutions for the C Programming Lab. I created this to keep my lab work organized and to have a quick reference for all the manual questions whenever needed.
I’m sharing this so you have a place to check the logic for our lab assignments. Feel free to use this as a study guide or a reference when you get stuck on a specific program.

Check for Errors: While I try to keep these accurate, the code might contain errors or bugs. Always double-check the logic before relying on it.
Advice:  Test everything yourself first!
